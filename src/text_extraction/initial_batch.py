'''pdf distinction:
we have to distinguish the format of the pdf and then we need to choose the French one
there are three different formats already detected
1) two coulumn documents (one column for French one column for Dutch)  
1.a) there is a line between them  
1.b) there is no line between them  
2) one language after the other format  
3) These texts start as two column for very first pages then continued like the other'''
